# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This change log only documents changes that are relevant to the end user. Changes that are only relevant to developers are not documented here.

Changes under the `Next` section reflect the unreleased changes that are currently in the `main` branch and will be released in the next version.

We **do not** use Semantic Versioning. In our scheme the third number is incremented for every release, while second number is incremented when we close a [milestone](https://github.com/habiteam/habitea/milestones). First number remains at 1, unless something crazy happens.
